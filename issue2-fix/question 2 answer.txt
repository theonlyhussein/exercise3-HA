An interesting fact about Git is that it allows you to visualize and analyze the history of your project in various ways, including using tools like git log and git blame. 
Here's how to do it:

Using git log for History Tracking:

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to your Git repository's root directory.

Use the git log command to display the commit history of your project. By default, it will show you a list of commits in reverse chronological order (the most recent commits first).

You'll see a list of commits with information such as the commit hash, author, date, and commit message.

You can customize the output of git log with various options. For example:

To see a condensed view of the commit history: " git log --oneline"

To see a graph-like representation of the commit history: "git log --graph"

To see the changes introduced by each commit: " git log -p " 

To limit the number of commits displayed: " git log -n 5  # Show the last 5 commits"

Using git blame for Line-by-Line History Tracking:

git blame allows you to see who last modified each line of a file and when. This can be helpful for tracking the history of specific code or identifying the author of a particular change.

Open your terminal.

Navigate to your Git repository's root directory.

Use the git blame command followed by the file's path to see line-by-line annotations.
